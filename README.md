# Arjun-Dulam 

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹!

My name's Arjun, and I'm a second year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech studying CS. My concentrations are Systems & Architecture and Modelling & Simulation.

I use my GitHub to share projects, notes, and exercises I've worked on. My primary interests include AI/ML projects, low-level programming in C, and high-performance, efficient systems in C++. Learning Rust by doing some system-level projects is also on my bucket list ðŸ™‚.

Currently learning more about ML.
